Free tools for Monogame development

This is a straight port of BulletXNA to Monogame

The actual physics system compiles to a class library built against the same version of .Net that Monogame uses so to use it you just need to add a reference in your Monogame app.

The demos have been restructured so they are included in a single application instead of multiple stand alone apps.

They have not been debugged or modified and have several bugs which could easily be fixed, but that is a task for other people.
